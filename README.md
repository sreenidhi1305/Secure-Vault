# SecureVault – Real-Time Ransomware Detection System

SecureVault is a robust, real-time ransomware detection and monitoring system developed with Python and PyQt6. It actively identifies ransomware-like behavior through a combination of advanced file monitoring, honeypot deployment, and CPU behavior analysis, aiming to prevent data damage before it occurs.
